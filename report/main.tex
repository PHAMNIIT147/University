        In this day of advancement, we are indispensable remote control to control
        the devices we use every day as televisions, machines air conditioners, fan, etc.
        So how do remote controls work? Can control other objects in the distance? 
        Few know that the first remote control available during World War II. 
        Initially, people use RF technology (Radio Frequency) and then catch to start applying 
        IR (Infarred Remote) technology to the remote control. In today's life, we use 
        both types, however control remote use infarred in more often used. Let's see the principle operation 
        and construction of this remote control.

    \section{Preliminary introduce:} 
        With the current trend of modernization and industrialization, many modern technology 
        devices appear to help save time. We can mention as public technology of things 
        connected through the internet (Internet of Things) etc. But with expensive fees 
        are not suitable for the average consumer. From there, i founded simple solutions 
        with the same purpose and low cost.
        \linebreak
        \par In parallel, to supplement, to supplement the knowledge not studied 
        in school. From there, i selected "Remote Controlled Using Infarred" for the topic.
    \section{Objectives of the study:}
        To help reduce costs and supplement knowledge not researched at school.
    \section{Research Methods:}
        Find information on internet. \\
        Test on software.

    \chapter{Find out theoretical related to the research}
    \section{Application of remote controlled using infarred}
        Remote controlled now is using broadly, it use to controlled all wireless device. 
        Remotes and televisions are the best example for application of this recieve and transmitter 
        circuit. Or more application of this circuit. Beside that, we can see that remote controlled 
        can use with air conditioners, fans, or even use to turn on the lights in house...etc.
        \section{Define of Infarred (IR LED)}
            Infarred light (infarred ray) is the light we can't see it by our eyes, 
            they have wavelength from 700nm to 1mm. The infarred light have transmittion speed 
            is equal to lightspeed.
            \linebreak
            \par The infarred can transmit many signal channels. It is widely 
            applied in industry.
