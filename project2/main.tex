        Radar is an object detection system. It uses Microwaves to determine the range, 
        altitude, or speed of objects. The radar can transmit radio waves or microwaves 
        which bounce off any object in their path. So, we can easily determine any object 
        in the radar range. Arduino is a single-board microcontroller to make electronics 
        more discipline. The radar system has different performance specifications and also 
        it comes in a verity of size.

    \subsection{The reason why to choose project}
        With the passion for aviation as well as passion for technology and equipment realted to 
        it, i decided to choose an aviation-related project in this project. Fortunately, my project 
        this time is on topic of embedded programming. So, i choose project named "NDB radar 
        detector module using Arduino". In this project, i will rely 
        on the NDB radar to make a small scale NDB radar detector model. So, to get 
        started in this project, we need to know what NDB radar is and how it works. \\
    \vspace{5mm}
        Recognize the continuous development of aviation technology. I want to add my own 
        knowledge about how a radar system works and a bit of creative idea for this device 
        that came along during i make this project. And that's why i choose this project for myself. \\

    \par You may ask how the processing application works here. It's very simple, the 
    Ultrasonic sensor collects the object information with the help of Arduino and passes 
    it to processing application, there is a simple Graphics application implemented which 
    mimic a radar screen.
    \subsection{Target Research}
        The short term goal of this topic is with the desire to learn and supplement the

                parts of machine with great precision. Servos are found in many places, from toys to home 
                electronics to cars and airplanes. If you have a radio-controlled model car, airplanes, 
                or helicopter, you are using at least a few servos. By rotating a shaft connected to the 
                engine throttle, a servo regulates the speed of a fuel-powered car or aircraft. \\
                    \vspace{2mm}
                    \par Servo also appear behind the scene in devices we use every day. Electronic device 
                such as DVD players use servos to extend or retract the disc trays.

                    \vspace{3mm}
                    \par The simple of a servo among the features that make them so reliable. 
                The heart of a servo is a small direct current (DC) motor, similar to what you 
                might find in an cheap toy. These motors run on electricity from a battery and spin 
                at high RPM(Rotations per minute) but put out very low \textbf{torque}(a twisting force 
                used to do work you apply torque when you open a bottle).

                    \end{figure}
                    \newpage
                    \par In high-power servo, the plastic gears are replaced by metal ones for strength. 
                    The motor is usually more powerful than in a low-power servo and the overall output torque 
                    can be as much as 20 times higher than a cheaper plastic one. Better quality is more 
                    expensive, and high-output servos can cost two or three times as much as standard ones.

                    \vspace{2mm}
                    \par With a small DC motor, you apply power from a battery, and the motor spins. 
                Unlike a simple DC motor, however, a servo's spinning motor shaft is slowed way down with 
                gears. A positional sensor on the final gear is connected to a small circuit board. The 
                sensor tells this circuit board how far the servo output shaft has rotated. The electronic 
                input signal from the computer or the radio in a remote-controlled vehicle also feeds into 
                that circuit board. The electronics on the circuit board decode the signals to determine 
                how far the user wants the servo to rotate. Then compares the desired position to the 
                actual position and decides which direction to rotate the shaft so it gets to the desired 
                position.

                \item \textbf{Types of servo motors}
                    \vspace{3mm}
                    \par Servos come in many sizes and in 3 basic types: 
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item \textbf{Positional rotation servo:} This is the most common type of servo 
                    motor. The output shaft rotates in about half of a circle, or 180 degrees. It has physical 
                    stops placed in the gear machanism to prevent turning beyond these limits to protect the 
                    rotational sensor. These common servos are found in radio-controlled cars, aircraft, toys, 
                    robots and many applications. 
                        \item \textbf{Continuous rotation servo:} This is quite similar to the common positional 
                    rotation servo motor, except it can turn in either direction indefinitely. The control 
                    signal, rather than setting the static position of the servo, is interpreted as the direction 
                    and speed of rotation. The range of possible commands causes the servo to rotate clockwise 
                    or counterclockwise as desired, at varying speed, depending on the command signal. You might 
                    use a servo of this type on a radar dish if you mounted one on a robot. Or you could use 
                    one as a drive motor on a mobile robot.
                        \item \textbf{Linear servo:} This is also like the positional rotation servo motor described 
                    above, but with additional gears(usually a \textbf{rack and pinion} mechanism) to change 
                    the output from circular to back-and-forth. These servos are not easy to find, but you can 
                    sometimes find them at hobby stores where they are used as actuators in larger model airplanes.
                    \end{itemize}

                    \newpage
                    Micro servo motor 90(SG90) is tiny and lightweight with high output power. This servo can 
                    rotate approximately 180 degrees (90 in each direction), it works just like the standard kinds 
                    but smaller. We can use any servo code, hardware or library to control this servo.
